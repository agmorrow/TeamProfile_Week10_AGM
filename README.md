# TeamProfile_Week11_AGM
## Description
I was given a task to build a Node-js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. Testing is key to making code maintainable, so I was also instructed to write a unit test for every part of your code and ensure that it passes each test. The user is prompted to enter the team name then inputs the manager for the team with the name, id number, email, and office number. The user can then choose to build an engineer, intern, or finish creating the team. The engineer dispkays their github profile, and the intern displays their school instead of their office number. All the information is displayed to a html file and all tests are passed.
